## 🚀 Objective

The goal of this analysis is to identify **revenue optimization opportunities** for Atliq Hotels through deep insights into pricing, occupancy, customer experience, and competitive positioning.

## 📊 Key Business Insights

### a. Dynamic Pricing Potential
Atliq currently uses a fixed ADR (Average Daily Rate). Introducing **flexible pricing models** (e.g., weekday vs. weekend rates or seasonal adjustments) can significantly boost revenue and align with market demand trends.

### b. Occupancy vs. ADR Relationship
High occupancy correlates with lower ADR, which can hurt profitability. **Refining the balance** between room rates and occupancy can improve revenue sustainability.

### c. Customer Experience & Occupancy
Regions with lower occupancy often show **poorer customer ratings**, indicating potential service gaps. Enhancing aspects like **breakfast quality or amenities** can improve reviews and attract more bookings.

### d. Competitive Pricing Strategy
While Atliq offers the lowest prices on direct online channels, **AI-based competitor pricing tools** can affect visibility. Strategies like **promo codes and loyalty discounts** can help counteract this.

### e. Missing Differential Pricing
Atliq has yet to implement **differentiated pricing** across guest types or booking windows, while many competitors already do. Adding this can align Atliq with **industry best practices**.
